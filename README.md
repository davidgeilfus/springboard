# Why Springboard?

More often than not, what we call front-end frameworks are actually giant UI kits. They come with dozens of ready-to-use components and strong opinions on how these should behave and look like.

While this makes for powerful prototyping tools, it also makes them bloated, hard to override and to scale.

On the other hand, Springboard aims to be a framework in the true sense of the word. It has a small footprint, does not force any design choice on you, and provides a solid foundation upon which to build any CSS project.

## Whatâ€™s included

Springboard includes the following:

* **A solid CSS architecture** based on [ITCSS](http://itcss.io), which will help you stay sane when you scale
* **A code as self-documenting as possible** by combining namespacing and [BEM](https://en.bem.info) naming conventions
* A collection of cosmetic-free objects

## Installation

To install Springboard using Bower, simply run:

```console
$ bower install --save springboard
```

Or to install it using npm:

```console
$ npm install --save springboard
```
