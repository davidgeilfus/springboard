# Why Springboard?

More often than not, what we call front-end frameworks are actually giant UI kits. They come packed with dozens of ready-to-use components, and strong opinions on how these should behave and look like.

While this makes for useful prototyping tools, it also makes them painful to override, and favors the production of bloated and hard to scale code bases.

By contrast, Springboard aims to be a framework in the true sense of the word. It has a tiny footprint, does not force any design choice on you, and provides a solid foundation upon which to build any CSS project.
